- Use pnpm
- Don't use relative imports. Use aliases set up in [tsconfig.json](mdc:tsconfig.json)
- Use Zod for validation. I have a custom validation pipe [zod-validation.pipe.ts](mdc:src/common/pipes/zod-validation.pipe.ts)
- Store DTOs and Interfaces in their respective folders and closer to where they are being used
