- Use pnpm
- Avoid relative imports; use aliases defined in [tsconfig.json](mdc:tsconfig.json)
- Use Zod for validation via the custom [zod-validation.pipe.ts](mdc:src/common/pipes/zod-validation.pipe.ts)
- Keep DTOs and interfaces in dedicated folders, close to their usage
- Write small, modular functions
- Ensure all code is production-grade: handle errors, follow best practices, and write clean, maintainable code
- Use context7 to check necessary libraries' docs before planning or making any code changes
- When writing tests, write tests to check behaviour and not how the function is implemented
- Don't import `describe`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach`, `it` from `vitest` as they are available globally as defined in [vitest.config.ts](mdc:vitest.config.ts)
- When facing linting errors, use `pnpm lint --fix` or `pnpm format` as a first step
